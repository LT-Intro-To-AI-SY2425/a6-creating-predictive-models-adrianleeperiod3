# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
 
 High Income, High Spending: High-Life Shoppers
 High Income, Low Spending: Mindful Shoppers
 Low Income, High Spending: Risky Shoppers
 Low Income, Low Spending: Frugal Shoppers
 Medium Income, Medium Spending: Average Shoppers

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

If not in the Average Shopper category, this type of customer would likey be in the Frugal or Mindful Shopper categories.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

Customers in the High-Life cluster may be more effected by marketing that caters towards quality or luxury products. Those who make and spend significant amounts of money (relative to the rest of the sample), may be more enticed to put more money into a product that trumps others in individual quality. Therefore, members of the cluster near the top-right of the graph would best be reached by marketing that emphasizes a well-built product.
